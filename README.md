# Scikit-learn-LDA-vs-Manual-LDA
Application of the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) algorithm from the scikit-learn package on the Iris dataset, followed by a manual implementation of LDA on the same dataset.  Jupyter notebook also contains a function for plotting the LDA decision boundaries on a plot of the first two linear discriminants. 

## Data source
Iris dataset imported from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data
